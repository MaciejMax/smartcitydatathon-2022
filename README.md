# Smart City Datathon 2022, Warsaw

During that Datathon, 9 great teams were solving challenges together with the City of Warsaw, focusing on topics such as:

ðŸ‘‰ Quality of living  
ðŸ‘‰ Transport & communication infrastructure  
ðŸ‘‰ Environmental protection, pollution & sustainable energy.  

# Our idea

Initially our team wanted to work on the prediction of safety-related incidents, based on reports in Warsaw City Contact Center (19115).

After some time working with the API, we encountered some difficulties in acquiring the data, so we decided to redefine our goal and:  
ðŸ‘‰ provide a solution for better city data sharing  
ðŸ‘‰ show examples how to easy analyse the data.  


# Our solution

We presented how to easily share the data and analyse it in Snowflake or locally, using other tools.  

## Repository contains:
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Safety-incident prediction.pdf` | Presentation |
| `00 Fetch data.ipynb` | Notebook used to fetch the data using API |  
| `data_raw/data_raw.zip` | Compressed raw responses collected during the datathon | 
| `snowflake/snowflake.sql` | SQL used to store loaded data and parse JSON |
